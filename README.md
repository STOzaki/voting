# Voting
This will help you with voting.


## Execute Program
1. On your terminal, go into the executable directory and then write the command "chmod u+x voting.jar".  This will give only you the ability to execute the voting.jar.
2. Simply go into the executable folder and run the voting.jar using the command "java -jar voting"

## Modifying the Program
1. Once you add the votingFrame.java, you need to add the java-json.jar, json-simple-1.1.jar, and org.json.jar to your project.


### To Note
1. You may not need to add both java-json.jar and org.json.jar.
2. You do not need to use the Voting.java.  It was simply a test file that I did not get rid of yet.
